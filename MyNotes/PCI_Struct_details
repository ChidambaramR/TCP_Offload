Imp PCI details about the devices

pci_device_id - This is not a local ID by linux, but a global ID assigned by PCI standard. 

pci_dev - Each pci device is assigned a pci_dev instance, just as network devices are.

pci_driver - Defines the interaction between the PCI layer and the device drivers. PCI device drivers are defined by an instance of a pci_driver structure. 
	name - Name of the driver.
	id_table - vector of ID's the kernel will use to associate devices to this driver
	probe - Function invoked by PCI layer when it finds a match between a device ID for which it is seeking the driver and the id_table. This function
		i. enables the hardware
		ii. allocates the net_device structure
		iii. Initialize and register the new device. 
		iv. Allocates additional data structures like buffer rings used during transmission reception.

	remove - invoked by PCI layer when driver is unregisterd from kernel. 
	suspend / resume - When system goes to suspend/resume this gets called.
