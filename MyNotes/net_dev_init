Explanation of net_dev_init

The net_dev_init is executed before any device driver has a chance to register its devices. 

1. When the kernel is compiled with the support of /proc file system, a few files are added to /proc with dev_proc_init and dev_mcast_init

2. netdev_sysfs_init registers the net class with sysfs. This creates the director /sys/class/net under which we will find a sub-directory for each registered network device

3. ptype_base is the protocol handler vector and used to demultiplex ingress traffic. 

4. OFFLINE_SAMPLES - Kernel setsup a function which should be run at regular intervals. 

5. dev_cpu_callback - call back function for hot plug cpu events. This is used when a CPU halts. When this function is called, the buffers in the CPU ingress queue are dequeued and sent to netif_rx.
