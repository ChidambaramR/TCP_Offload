How ethtool works

1. When we issue ethtool command, an ioctl is done. The command type is SIOCETHTOOL.

2. This is received by function dev_ioctl.
	File: net/core/dev.c#L4454

3. The call again goes to dev_ethtool. The user supplied argument is passed via the struct ifreq's argument ifr. The dev_ethool function is found in net/core/ethtool.c#L896

4. It checks for the following.
	1. If device present.
	2. Each net_device structure has a pointer ethtool_ops which has a list of function pointers. 
	The net_device data structure includes a pointer to a VFT of type ethtool_ops. The latter structure is a collection of function pointers that can be used to both read and initialize a bunch of parameters on the net_device structure, or to trigger an action
